\
## 1. Game Overview\
This project is a simple **[type of game, e.g. console snake / dodging game / etc.]** written in **[language]**.  \
The main idea is that the player **[describe goal in 1\'962 lines]**.\
\
## 2. Files and Structure\
- `main.[c/cpp/... ]` \'96 starting point of the game, contains `main()` and the main loop.\
- `[other files]` \'96 short one-line description of what they do.\
\
## 3. Main Game Flow\
Rough flow of the program:\
\
1. Initialize variables (player position, enemy position, etc.).\
2. Enter a game loop where:\
   - User input is taken from the keyboard.\
   - Positions of player / obstacles are updated.\
   - Collisions or game-over conditions are checked.\
   - The current game state is drawn on the console.\
3. When the player loses, the loop ends and a game-over message is shown.\
\
## 4. Important Variables / Functions\
Some key parts I noticed:\
\
- `[...]` \'96 stores player position.\
- `[...]` \'96 stores obstacle/enemy position.\
- `[...]` \'96 condition that decides game over.\
\
Functions:\
\
- `[...]` \'96 handles user input.\
- `[...]` \'96 updates game state.\
- `[...]` \'96 prints or draws the game screen.\
\
## 5. My Understanding\
In simple words, every turn the game:\
1. Reads what key I pressed.\
2. Changes the positions based on that.\
3. Checks if it is a hit/collision.\
4. Shows the new frame.\
\
This is the basic logic on which I will add my own features in Objective 2.}
